## Overview
- This was a 'review' project to move back into programming with JavaScript and React from other Python projects. Through troubleshooting styling issues - I have now created a different [react-starter](https://github.com/wright-donovan/react-website-starter) so the css isn't so disorganized. 
- The code base is disorgnanzied - posted to display capabilities recreating content based on ux/ui design
- Design taken from [Avi Yansah](https://dribbble.com/aviyansah)
