## Overview
- **Unfinished** 
- This was a 'review' project to begin programming in JavaScript and React again after completing other Python related projects. 
- The code base is disorgnanzied - posted to display capabilities recreating content based on pre-defined ux/ui design
- Design taken from [Avi Yansah](https://dribbble.com/aviyansah) 

## Learnings ðŸ““
- Styled components became difficult to organize and keep efficient 
- Future projects (example - [barber-shop](https://github.com/wright-donovan/barber-shop)) will use a different [react-starter](https://github.com/wright-donovan/react-website-starter) so other developers can easily navigate to the styles associated with the components.
